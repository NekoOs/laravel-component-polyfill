# Laravel Component Polyfill
 Laravel 5.8 or lower support

Languages: English | [EspaÃ±ol](README.es.md)

# Benefits
- You can use components as if you were on Laravel 8.x version from your old Laravel version
  5.8, in situations where migrating your project is impossible.
- You can feel confident to perform a migration later by simply removing this library and adopting the new
  version of the Framework.

# Backstory

Some time ago [Laravel Blade-X](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-blade-x/v2/introduction) presented us with a proposal of
components on steroids and after Laravel 7 adopted it officially into the Framework as [Blade Components]().
as [Blade Components](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade#components), however, this caused SPATIE to withdraw the support and also the namespaces of the
support and also SPATIE namespaces differ from Laravel.

Therefore, I took it upon myself to create this polyfill to make sure the interfaces match and take advantage of the power of `Blade-X`.
power of `Blade-X`.

## Installation

## Documentation

See [Laravel Blade Components](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade#components) for component usage information.
components:   

```php
<?php

namespace App\View\Components;

use IlluminateViewComponent;

class Alert extends Component
{
    public $type;
    
    public $message;
    
    public function __construct($type, $message)
    {
        $this->type = $type;
        $this->message = $message;
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return 'components.alert';
    }
}
```

```php
<x-alert type="error" :message="$message"/>
```

You will notice that the only significant change at the moment is the return of the `render` method, in Laravel this method returns a `View` instance and not the name of the `blade` file. 
an instance of `View` and not the name of the `blade` file, however you can override the `view()` function to make it easier to use in the future.
